# Setup

nio-template is a sample repository of a working Matrix bot that can be taken
and transformed into one's own bot, service or whatever else may be necessary.
Below is a quick setup guide to running the existing bot. For guidance on how
to get started on transforming the codebase into your own, personalised
chatbot, see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Install the dependencies

There are two paths to installing the dependencies for development.

### Using `docker-compose`

It is **recommended** to use Docker Compose to run the bot while
developing, as all necessary dependencies are handled for you. After
installation and ensuring the `docker-compose` command works, you need to:

1. Create a data directory and config file by following the
   [docker setup instructions](docker#setup).

2. Create a docker volume pointing to that directory:

   ```
   docker volume create \
     --opt type=none \
     --opt o=bind \
     --opt device="/path/to/data/dir" data_volume
   ```

Run `docker/start-dev.sh` to start the bot.

**Note:** If you are trying to connect to a Synapse instance running on the
host, you need to allow the IP address of the docker container to connect. This
is controlled by `bind_addresses` in the `listeners` section of Synapse's
config. If present, either add the docker internal IP address to the list, or
remove the option altogether to allow all addresses.

### Running natively

If you would rather not or are unable to run docker, the following will
instruct you on how to install the dependencies natively:

#### Install libolm

You can install [libolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm) from source,
or alternatively, check your system's package manager. Version `3.0.0` or
greater is required.

**(Optional) postgres development headers**

By default, the bot uses SQLite as its storage backend. This is fine for a few
hundred users, but if you plan to support a much higher volume of requests, you
may consider using Postgres as a database backend instead.

If you want to use postgres as a database backend, you'll need to install
postgres development headers:

Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install libpq-dev libpq5
```

Arch:

```
sudo pacman -S postgresql-libs
```

#### Install Python dependencies

Create and activate a Python 3 virtual environment:

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install python dependencies:

```
pip install -e .
```

(Optional) If you want to use postgres as a database backend, use the following
command to install postgres dependencies alongside those that are necessary:

```
pip install -e ".[postgres]"
```

## Configuration

Copy the sample configuration file to a new `config.yaml` file.

```
cp sample.config.yaml config.yaml
```

Edit the config file. The `matrix` section must be modified at least.

#### (Optional) Set up a Postgres database

Create a postgres user and database for matrix-reminder-bot:

```
sudo -u postgresql psql createuser nio-template -W  # prompts for a password
sudo -u postgresql psql createdb -O nio-template nio-template
```

Edit the `storage.database` config option, replacing the `sqlite://...` string with `postgres://...`. The syntax is:

```
database: "postgres://username:password@localhost/dbname?sslmode=disable"
```

See also the comments in `sample.config.yaml`.

## Running

### Docker

Refer to the docker [run instructions](docker/README.md#running).

### Native installation

Make sure to source your python environment if you haven't already:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Then simply run the bot with:

```
my-project-name
```

You'll notice that "my-project-name" is scattered throughout the codebase. When
it comes time to modifying the code for your own purposes, you are expected to
replace every instance of "my-project-name" and its variances with your own
project's name.  Details on doing so are described in
[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

By default, the bot will run with the config file at `./config.yaml`. However, an
alternative relative or absolute filepath can be specified after the command:

```
my-project-name other-config.yaml
```

## Testing the bot works

Invite the bot to a room and it should accept the invite and join.

By default nio-template comes with an `echo` command. Let's test this now.
After the bot has successfully joined the room, try sending the following
in a message:

```
!c echo I am a bot!
```

The message should be repeated back to you by the bot.

## Going forwards

Congratulations! Your bot is up and running. Now you can modify the code,
re-run the bot and see how it behaves. Have fun!

## Troubleshooting

If you had any difficulties with this setup process, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template/issues]) or come talk
about it in [the matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#nio-template).
